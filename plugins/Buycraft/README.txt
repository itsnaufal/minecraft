---- RECENT PAYMENT SIGNS --------------------------------------------------

If you would like to display recent payments in game, this feature allows you to
setup a row of signs with head blocks placed above/below/next to them. Every 30 minutes
the signs will update and show the most recent users who have purchased a package.
To enable this feature you need to set "headsEnabled" to "true" in the settings.conf file.

Place a row of signs in any order you wish, with one head per sign at least one block away. 
After you have placed the signs and heads, type "buysign begin" in game. Then click on the signs
in the order you wish the payments to be displayed. Once you have finished, type "buysign end" - 
the signs will update accordingly.

You can also filter the signs to only include payments that include a certain package. 
Use "buysign filter <Package ID>" after typing "buysign begin" to do this. 

---- MCMYADMIN INTERGRATION ------------------------------------------------

If you are aiming to use McMyAdmin commands in packages, prefix the commands you enter with "{mcmyadmin}", for example,
to execute the McMyAdmin "stop" command, you would enter this: "{mcmyadmin}stop". After you have setup the commands, you need
to give administrator access to the user "Buycraft" (Case sensitive) in the McMyAdmin permissions page. The user "Buycraft" has
been disabled from logging in to your server to prevent administrator access in game.


---- CHANGING THE /BUY COMMAND ---------------------------------------------

To change the /buy command please edit the setting in the configuration file.
